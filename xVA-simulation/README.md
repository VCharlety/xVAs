# xVA Simulation Project

## Overview
The xVA simulation project is designed to analyze and simulate various financial metrics related to xVA (Valuation Adjustments). This project provides tools for data analysis, visualization, and the execution of complex financial models.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **data/**: Contains sample data used for the xVA simulation.
  - `sample_data.csv`: A CSV file with various financial metrics relevant to the simulation.

- **notebooks/**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive analysis.
  - `xVA_simulation.ipynb`: The main notebook for running the xVA simulation, including data analysis and visualization.

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the simulation.
  - `main.py`: The entry point of the simulation project, responsible for initializing the simulation and orchestrating execution.
  - **models/**: Contains financial models used in the simulation.
    - `__init__.py`: Initializes the models package.
  - **utils/**: Contains utility functions for data processing and analysis.
    - `__init__.py`: Initializes the utils package.
  - **calculations/**: Contains functions for performing calculations related to xVA metrics.
    - `__init__.py`: Initializes the calculations package.

- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- Launch the Jupyter notebook `xVA_simulation.ipynb` to start the simulation and analysis.
- Modify the `sample_data.csv` file as needed to test different scenarios.
- Use the `main.py` file to run the simulation programmatically.
